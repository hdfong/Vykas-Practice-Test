# Vykas Practice Test

This is a practice tool for the typing test in Lost Ark's Vykas legion raid. I used the [Net Ninja's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gXdVXVJBmHpSI7zCEcjLUX) [Wordle Clone in React](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/React-Wordle) as a reference for this project.

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Node.js

## Learning Objectives

- Build and style a web app using React.js and Node.js
- Implement and practice react functional components to modularize code and make it easier to understand on large scale projects
- Implement and practice CSS styling and short animations
- Refamiliarize myself with deploying apps using Heroku
- Practice writing better readme files

## Useful commands

If you're going to build this on your own machine, here are some commands from the default readme for Create React App.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
